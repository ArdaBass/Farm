# ðŸŒ± Plant Growth Simulation

This project was my **first semester programming assignment** in university. It simulates the growth of plants on a grid over time based on a series of planting instructions read from a file. The goal was to practice **file I/O, loops, arrays**, and **basic algorithmic thinking** using C++.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Description

The program:
- Reads the dimensions of a plant grid from a file
- Simulates planting steps over multiple years
- Tracks how many times each grid cell is planted
- Applies a simple aging rule: if a plant remains unchanged for a year, it weakens (value decreases)
- Outputs the final plant grid
